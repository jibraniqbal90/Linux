Steps:
  1. Install Plymouth : pacman -S plymouth
  
  2. Modify /etc/mkinitcpio.conf
  
  3. In that file, find the HOOKS array. It should look something like this:
  	--> HOOKS=(base udev [...])  
  	--> Just add plymouth : HOOKS=(base udev plymouth [...])
  	
  4. Next, in the same file, we need to tell the system to load the Driver module early on, so that plymouth can show the cool animations and stuff
  
  5. Find "Modules" in mkinitcpio.conf and add the driver: MODULES=(i915)
    	--> In my case it is : i915
	--> To find out which driver you are using you can use the command : lspci -k | grep -EA3 'VGA|3D|Display'
	
  6. Build linux kernel image again: sudo mkinitcpio -p linux59. In my case it is linux59 but we can find the correct linux kernel:
  	--> Goto /etc/mkinitcpio.d
  	--> Look for all presets and select the one you want
  		
  7. Next up, we need to actually call plymouth during boot. For that we will modify the grub. Edit the file:
  	--> /etc/default/grub
  		
  8. In the file, look for a line that looks like the following:
	--> GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT="quiet ..."
	--> Modify it to pass in “splash” after the “quiet” parameter, like so:
	--> GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT="quiet splash ..."
		
  9. Update the grub to reflect the modified parameters by running:
	--> sudo update-grub
	        
  10. Switch the Display manager. In my case it is sddm
  	--> sudo systemctl disable sddm.service
  	--> sudo systemctl enable sddm-plymouth.service
  		
  11. By default it uses spinner theme. If we want to change the theme the follow the below steps:
  	--> Download the theme and extract it to the following path: /usr/share/plymouth/themes/
  		
  12. Now to list all the themes fire the command: sudo plymouth-set-default-theme -l
  
  13. To set the theme fire the command: sudo plymouth-set-default-theme -R <Theme Name>
  
  14. Reboot
